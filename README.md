# Express API Demo

This repository demonstrates my approach to API development with Express. It features a simple API with a posts route using [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) as mock data.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/express-api-demo.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## Endpoints

- `POST /posts`
- `GET /posts/:id`
- `PATCH /posts/:id`
- `DELETE /posts/:id`
